      <h2>Definition of a Vertebrate</h2>
      <p>A vertebrate is an animal that has a backbone and a skeleton. Vertebrate animals include humans. When you think about vertebrates, think about bones: this word has to do with animals that have a lot of bones, in the form of a skeleton. It especially refers to animals with a backbone, which protects their spinal cord.</p>
   <h2>Simple Definition of a Vertebrate</h2>
      <p>Animals that have a backbone are called vertebrates. The backbone is is a column of bones that supports the body, and also protects the spinal cord. The back is made up of many separate bones, called vertebrae. The backbone is part of a vertebrate's supportive internal skeleton.</p>
      <h2>Children's Definition of a Vertebrate</h2>
